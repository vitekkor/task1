# task1
New project for the 2nd semester. The first task to create a class.
## First class - Complex
The class "complex number". Class object is a complex number of the form x+yi. Constructor arguments are real and imaginary parts of a number.
### Supported methods:
 * addition
 * subtraction
 * unary minus
 * multiplication
 * division
 * convert from/to string
 ## Second class - TrainTimeTable.
Class "train schedule".
 The class object stores the train schedule for a specific departure station.The name of the departure station for this schedule is passed to the constructor. For each train, the final station and a list of intermediate stations are stored.
### Supported methods:
 * add a new train
 * delete a train
 * add / remove an intermediate station to an existing passageway
 * search for trains by time. 
 * return a list of all trains ordered by departure time with `baseStationName` 
  ## Third class - UnsignedBigInteger
Class "unsigned big integer".
 An object of the class contains an unsigned integer of arbitrary size and supports basic operations on such numbers.
 ### Supported methods:
  * addition
  * subtraction (when subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, an exception is thrown)
  * multiplication
  * division
  * remainder of division
  * convert to string/from string
  * convert to whole/from whole
  * comparison for equality and inequality
  #### Fourth class - Wedding `in the development`
